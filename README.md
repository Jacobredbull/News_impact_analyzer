## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# git clone https://github.com/Jacobredbull/News_impact_analyzer.git
cd News_impact_analyzer
```
## 2. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment.
Create and activate a virtual environment
``` python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install all required packages from the requirements file
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3. Set Up API Keys

You need a NewsAPI.org key for this project.

Go to NewsAPI.org and register for a free developer key.

Set the key as an environment variable named NEWS_API_KEY.

If you plan to use OpenAI or Google Gemini, you will need to get their respective API keys and paste them into the input box in the app's sidebar.

## 4. (Optional) Set Up Ollama

If you want to use a local model:

Install Ollama.

Pull a model from your command line, for example: ollama pull llama3.1

## 5. Create the Ticker Cache

Before your first run, you must download the list of valid stock tickers. Run the validator script once from your terminal:

```Bash
python ticker_validator.py
This creates an all_tickers.txt file in your project directory.
```
